# 👋 Hi, I'm Leila Setti

## 🌱 About me

I enjoy working on projects that combine **technical depth** with **real-world impact**.  
I'm especially drawn to fields where AI and vision systems can solve concrete problems and help us better understand or act on the world around us.

I'm also passionate about **sharing knowledge**, whether through building tools, writing clear documentation, or creating educational material that helps others learn.
